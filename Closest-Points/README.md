# Programming Assignment #2: Closest Pair

In this programming assignment we write a divide and conquer algorithm to find the closest pair of points among n points on a two-dimensional plane.

The file with named naive.py provides the naive implementation that solves the problem in O(n^2).

We are tasked with writing a O(nlogn) algorithm that can find the closest pair of points among n points on a two-dimensional plane.
